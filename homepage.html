        An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization
        for a limited period of time.[1] Once confined to medical graduates,
        internship is used practice for a wide range of placements in
        businesses, non-profit organizations and government agencies. They are
        typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain relevant
        skills and experience in a particular field. Employers benefit from
        these placements because they often recruit employees from their best
        interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the
        long run. Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations
        that recruit interns on behalf of industry groups. Rules vary from
        country to country about when interns should be regarded as employees.
        The system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous
        employers.[citation needed] Internships for professional careers are
        similar in some ways. Similar to internships, apprenticeships transition
        students from vocational school into the workforce. The lack of
        standardization and oversight leaves the term "internship" open to broad
        interpretation. Interns may be high school students, college and
        university students, or post-graduate adults. These positions may be
        paid or unpaid and are temporary.[2] Many large corporations,
        particularly investment banks, have "insights" programs that serve as a
        pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or
        virtually.
